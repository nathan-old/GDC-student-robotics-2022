# Goldalming college student robotics
Repo for Godalming College Student Robotics.

# Running
After powering on the robot, wait for either of the preboot audio status and then press the start button. The robot will try to boot, launch modules and perform diagnostic checks and will spit errors.

# Folders
- 3d parts: Will contain cad designs relevant to the robot
- Docs: all relevant documentation to do with the hardware
- robot: The code that was written and run for the competition
- Arduino: Contains the scripts for the Arduino
- demos: Demonstration scripts that dont interface with any other robot code to prove consepts

# For GDC student robotics 2023
Feel free to use as much code as you like, the code runs a route from route files. To write a route file refer to the writing routes.md file in Docs folder. The parts in the 3D-parts folder should be up to date with components curr on the robot. In Docs there should also be a Rpm_spreadsheet file that contains the data collected for our motors at given power levels. This is used to give a speed which is then induvidually calibrated per movement function.

Good Luck :)
