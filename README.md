# Goldalming college student robotics
Repo for Godalming College Student Robotics.

# Running
After powering on the robot, wait for either of the preboot audio status and then press the start button. The robot will try to boot, launch modules and perform diagnostic checks and will spit errors.

# Folders
- 3d parts: Will contain cad designs relevant to the robot
- Docs: all relevant documentation to do with the hardware
- Robert: The code that Robert has written (may be moved and changed)
- Arduino: Contains the scripts for the Arduino
- demos: Demonstration scripts that dont interface with any other robot code to prove consepts
- Robot: original robot modules and code

# TODO
- Offset for camera to robot centre
- Offset to grabber
- Flag mount
- Cable management
- Create spare part assemblies
- Hard-coded movement instructions
- Create return to home function
- Make USB's accessible for COMP mode + code USB stick
- Improve looks of robot
- Give robot a name
- Can recognition library 
- Decision making system (which can to go for)
- Update all can locations, marker locations and location of centeral box
- Make robot do reliable and accurate distances/turns
