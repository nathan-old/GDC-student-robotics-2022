- 3d parts: Will contain cad designs relevant to the robot
- Docs: all relevant documentation to do with the hardware
- Robert: The code that Robert has written (may be moved and changed)
- Arduino: Contains the scripts for the Arduino
- demos: Demonstration scripts that dont interface with any other robot code to prove consepts
- Robot: original robot modules and code
